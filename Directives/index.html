      <label >First name</label>

      <!-- v-model directive is used to bind the value of the 'firstName' input element
       to the firstName property of the data object. 
       
       The code can be read like this:
       Bind the value of the input element with the type of "text" 
       to the firstName property of the data object.
      -->

      <label for="">Middle name</label>
      <input type="text" @keyup.enter="updateMiddleName">
      <!--The @keyup.enter directive is a way of binding an event listener to the input element. 
        In this case, it's binding an event listener that will call the updateMiddleName method
        whenever the user presses the Enter key while focused on the input element. -->

      <label >Last name</label>
      <input type="text" :value="lastName"
       @input.prevent="updateLastName('Last name event trigger!',$event)" >

      <!--example of a two-way data binding in Vue.js. 
        In this case, the value attribute of the input element is bound to the lastName property of the data object.
        This means that whenever the value of the input element changes, the lastName property will also be updated. 

        The @input event is a way of binding an event listener to the input element. In this case, it's binding 
        an input event listener that will call the updateLastName method whenever the input element is changed.
      
        The @input.prevent directive is a way of binding an event listener to the input element. 
        In this case, it's binding an input event listener that will call the updateLastName method 
        whenever the input element is changed. The .prevent modifier tells Vue to call the default 
        action of the event (in this case, the submission of the form) and then stop the propagation
        of the event up the DOM tree. This means that the event will not be handled by parent elements,
        which may have their own event listeners for the input event. 
        The $event argument is a reference to the native DOM event that triggered the input event.

      <label >Age</label>
      <input type="number" v-model.number="age">

      <!-- The v-model.number directive is a way of binding the value of an input element with 
        the type of "number" to a property on the component. In this case, it's binding the value 
        of the input element to the age property of the data object. The .number modifier tells 
        Vue to treat the value of the input element as a number, which means that any user input 
        will be converted to a number before being assigned to the age property. 
        This is useful when working with numeric data, as it ensures that the data is always 
        represented as a number, even if the user enters a value that contains decimal points 
        or other non-numeric characters. -->

      <button type="button" v-on:click="increment">Increment</button>

      <!--The v-on:click directive is a way of binding an event listener to a DOM element.
         In this case, it's binding a click event listener to the button element. -->
      <button type="button" @click.ctrl="age--">Decrement</button>

    <!-- <div id="app2">
